## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine.
- A running MongoDB database instance.
- Update the database connection settings in each app's `index.js` file to match your MongoDB configuration.

## Notes
- These examples use the `mongodb` library to interact with MongoDB.
- Ensure your MongoDB database is running and accessible before starting the applications.
- Example data or schemas may be included in the respective folders.
